<p>This page is a complete work of <b><i>FICTION</i></b> 
all names, books, films, or references to other sites are
parodic and expressly made for this assignment. Any likeness is purely coincidental.</p>
	<p> This is a fictious website devoted to a fictitious American horror author "Harris VonGrotten". And that said, this site is taking the form a a devoted fan site for the author that is a congregation point for fans to meet. As well as being the site where the author reaches out to fans and keeps them in the loop on his current projects. It consists of a diary styled blog, an active movie page for one of his projects, biography, as well as online shop so people may buy his books and merchandise. Our aim was to make a character that was a enigmatic Stephen King knock off.</p>
