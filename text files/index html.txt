			<h1> Welcome! </h1>
				<p> Here at the VonGrotten Fan Page, we follow the horror author's work,
				 from the likes of <i> The Spiraling in the Wheel House </i> to <i> Dead
				 Man's Nails </i>. We even cover some of the author's more underrated 
				 classics - such as <i> Deeds of the Flesh </i> and <i> 
				 The Watcher from The Dark </i>. </p>
				<p>Harris VonGrotten is an American visual and psychedelic horror artist born on October 24, 1985 in Little Haven, Ohio. 
				And attended Northpin High, Ohio during his highschool career. Being born the youngest of three siblings, Harris was left to his own devices most times and found a passion for art where he had one several art contests and had a piece placed in a gallery his senior year of highschool. Upon graduating from school he moved to Georgia where he attended Saint’s pass college, earning himself a teaching and art degree. Harris would then proceed to try and sell art as well as return to Ohio and teach in Willamette Heights. 
				Though, as he taught, he realized this wasn’t the career he wanted. Being the artisan he was, he began writing thesis papers and short stories- mailing them out to local magazines and publishing companies hoping to break into a new field. None of his stories were received well within the early days of his career, and Harris often jokes about using all his rejection letters as the wall paper to his office. 
	It wasn’t until his big break with “Children Beneath the Stars” which was self published that Harris became a household name in America, his books selling out from book chains. With his success, Harris devoted all his time to art and financing his new lifestyle. It was within an art exhibit that Harris met his current wife Jannete Curry. 
	The both were married June 7th, in 2010 thus moved to a cottage in Pennsylvania. They had their first son two years later named Oliver with rumor of a second child on the way. 
	When Harris isn’t writing he goes on art tours and runs a successful publishing company to give upcoming and unconventional horror authors a chance to master their craft.
