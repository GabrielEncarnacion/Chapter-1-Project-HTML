			<h1> FILMING IN PROGRESS </h1>
			<h2> <b><p> FOR THE NEW </p></b></h2>

				<h1> <i>"Watcher From The Dark"</i> </h1>
			<p> Yes, it is true- the new <i> "Watcher From the Dark" </i> movie had begun filming after years of false starts and cancellations from a number of different studios. Harris' magnum opus about the decent into madness via opium and a connection to the other side is finally being realized and is being finded by a list of backers from the site "Git Star-d". Filming began earlier this year and the progeress of the film is being reported on by this page- with the recent outbreak of COVID-19/Corona, while the production may be slowed, Harris has garenteed the film will be ready for a 2021 release date and assures everyone that he is both at the helm for writing the adpatation as well as directing and staring as it's lead protagonist.
				<p> While exact details about who the rest of the cast will be played by is unclear, we will be getting an inside scoop from Harris himself about the working conditions and what percautions he is taking to ensure both he and his actor's are safe admist this pandemic. Many speculate about who all has been cast, names like Lawrence Harlson from <i>"Hell's Rugged Walker"</i>,<i>The Indecent Games</i>, and <i> Fool's Gold </i> is rumored to play the sadistic specter Morlolo. Other stars rumored to appear in the film are Diana Welcen, Bridgette Delorene, Johnathan Frank, as well as Zackary Tellhouse.</p>
			<p> With this all star cast, it is hard not to be exciting for this project that at one point was deemed to be unfilmable. Let us know down below what you think and what you're most excited about with this film.
