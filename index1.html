			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p> Here at the VonGrotten Fan Page, we follow the horror author's work,
				 from the likes of <i> The Spiraling in the Wheel House </i> to <i> Dead
				 Man's Nails </i>. We even cover some of the author's more underrated 
				 classics - such as <i> Deeds of the Flesh </i> and <i> 
				 The Watcher from The Dark </i>. </p>
				<p id="my-blue-paragraph">Harris VonGrotten is an American visual and psychedelic horror artist
				 born on October 24, 1985, in Little Haven, Ohio. Being born the youngest
				 of three siblings, Harris was left to his own devices most times and found
				 a passion for art. Harrison was a natural prodigy, winning several art
				 contests and having a piece selected for a private gallery. He started
				 off his career as a high school art teacher within the small sleepy town
				 of Williamite Heights in Ohio. Having left his job to pursue more
				 personal ventures, he began writing for local papers and found a passion
				 for crafting stories. Because of this, he began sending many manuscripts
					from some of our favorite stories out to any publisher he could.</p>

				<p> Having been rejected so many times, VonGrotten finally decided to
				 publish his own work under "Darkly Inkings Publishing." Finding success in
				 his short story "Children Beneath the Stars", Vongrotten began publishing 
				 more of his works and eventually meeting and marrying a coworker by the name
				 of Jannette Curry. The both now have two children and live in a secluded home
				 in rural Pennsylvania, where VonGrotten still continues his craft and making
				 new and exciting forms of expressionistic horror - both in writing and in art. </p>
